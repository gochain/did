# Decentralized Identity (did) and Verifiable Credentials

Code and tools for decentralized identity and verifiable claims/credentials.

For identity, we're generally following the w3c spec. You can find the contract for the did registry [here](https://github.com/gochain/identity/blob/master/did-registry.sol) and some code examples for generating them [here](https://github.com/gochain/web3/blob/master/cmd/web3/did.go).

This is not very well documented yet. If you can't, please post a public issue in this repository to get help.
